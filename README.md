### Project Description
Thalathirinja Web is a hilariously chaotic website where everything works in reverse — from mouse movements to scrolling and even navigation behavior. It’s designed to mess with your brain and provide a fun, unpredictable browsing experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Who needs a normal website? Sometimes, the internet is just too straightforward and boring. What if everything you do online was flipped upside down? That’s the problem nobody knew they needed solved.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a website where the mouse moves backward, scrolling feels like rewinding, and buttons behave in the opposite way you expect — because confusing users is an art form! It’s the perfect site for those who want to experience the web in a “thalathirinja” (reversed) style.
