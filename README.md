### Project Description
Thalathirinja Web is a hilariously chaotic website where everything works in reverse — from mouse movements to scrolling and even navigation behavior. It’s designed to mess with your brain and provide a fun, unpredictable browsing experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Who needs a normal website? Sometimes, the internet is just too straightforward and boring. What if everything you do online was flipped upside down? That’s the problem nobody knew they needed solved.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a website where the mouse moves backward, scrolling feels like rewinding, and buttons behave in the opposite way you expect — because confusing users is an art form! It’s the perfect site for those who want to experience the web in a “thalathirinja” (reversed) style.

This is the landing page of our Useless Project. It's designed to immediately set the tone: chaotic, nonsensical, and intentionally broken.

Before you can even step into the chaos, you have to prove you're worthy. Most users will instinctively click the giant, flashy, reversed title. That's when they are met with our first "feature": This friendly pop-up, written in pure Manglish, gently reminds the user that on this website, the obvious path is always the wrong one. Poyi real button kand pidikkoo! (Go find the real button!)

Once the user finds the real button, they are taken to the heart of our project: a quiz designed by madmen.
Everything is backward, the questions are designed to trick you, and logic has officially left the chat. After Completing all the questions there will be a submit button that dodges the cursor, moving randomly until the user finally manages to click it.

Your grand prize for all that effort? A cheerful message confirming you've successfully wasted your time. You're welcome!
